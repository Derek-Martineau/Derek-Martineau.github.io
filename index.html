        <div class="timeline-content">I was selected as a recipient of the 2023 Robert E. Briney Computer Science Service Award. </br> </br>  Dr. Robert E. Briney was a member of the Salem State College faculty from 1968 through his retirement in 2008. He was a faculty member of the Mathematics Department until 1977 prior to becoming the chair of Salem State’s Computer Science (CS) department. He then served as the chair of the CS department for four terms. He was the principal author of the proposal that led to the establishment of a Computer Science major in 1984. He made significant contributions to the major’s curriculum development and ABET accreditation up to his retirement. To honor the contributions made by Dr. Briney, the Robert E. Briney Foundation established this award in 2021.<br><br>
          The Robert E. Briney Computer Science Service Award is awarded each academic year to the undergraduate junior/senior student in the Computer Science major program who served the major and the department in general. Through your hard work and determination, you have proven to be a student that the CS Department wants to recognize.</div>

          Hosting my second programming competition was an exciting and fulfilling experience for both myself and the SSU Programming Club. Building upon the success of our first competition, we were able to further refine our event planning and execution, delivering an even more engaging and challenging experience for participants. The competition attracted a wider pool of talented programmers, creating a vibrant atmosphere of friendly competition and knowledge sharing. With carefully crafted problem sets and well-designed coding challenges, we were able to push participants' skills to new heights and provide a platform for them to showcase their abilities. The event was a testament to the hard work and dedication of our club members, who worked tirelessly to organize every aspect, from logistics and promotion to securing sponsorships and arranging prizes. Hosting this second programming competition solidified our club's reputation as a leading hub for programming enthusiasts on campus, and it served as a catalyst for fostering a culture of innovation, collaboration, and continuous learning within the local tech community.</div>

        <div class="timeline-content">Embarking on the journey of tutoring software programming courses was a fulfilling experience that allowed me to share my knowledge and passion for programming with fellow students. As a tutor, I had the opportunity to guide and support learners in various courses, including Java I & II, Intro to Programming, and Data Structures and Algorithms. It involved breaking down complex concepts into understandable chunks, providing clear explanations, and offering practical examples to facilitate comprehension. Witnessing the "aha" moments when students grasped challenging topics and gained confidence in their programming skills was incredibly rewarding. The tutoring experience not only solidified my understanding of the subjects but also honed my communication and problem-solving abilities. It was a privilege to be part of their learning journey and to contribute to their growth and success in the field of software programming.</div>
